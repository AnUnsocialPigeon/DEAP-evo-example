- Change it such that the predator is evaluated against everything *once*, then that is used in the evaulation function for the prey. 
    - Currently, the program is way too slow, as getting the AI to evaluate everything every time the prey needs to test itself is bad.
    - At least it is a proof of concept?
    - Shouldn't be a large change.
    
{Add more ideas here I guess...}
